----------JS------------------
var,let,const;

var:
    - Functional scope - if variable is declared in the global scope and it will be consider as global scope
    - these variables are hoisted and initialized undefined at first- can declare any part of the global scope.
    - can be re declare within the same scope where the varable dclaration is done.


Ex: errors & hoisting
------------------------
//console.log(a,b,c,d); // a is not defined
a = 1; 
//console.log(a,b,c,d); // c and d are cannot accessible before its value initialization
var b;
let c;
const d = 4;

console.log(a,b,c,d); // undefined for let after declaration and before intialization - let & const are not hoisted
    // undefined for var just before value initialization and can be declared anywhere - var and function def are hoisted to the top of the scope
b = 2;
c = 3;
console.log(a,b,c,d);

EX: scope
----------
console.log("x-value",x) // x is hoisted to global scope as declared in global scope **; undefined
//console.log(y) // y is functional scope hoisted, **: not defined/ not declared

var x = 10;
function example() {
    console.log("y-value",y) // y is hoistd in function scope as it is delared inside a function
  var y = 20;
}

example();

console.log("x-value",x) // x is part of global scope, **: 10
//console.log("y-value",y) // y is part of example functional scope, **: not defined.
