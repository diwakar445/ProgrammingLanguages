1.Which of the following cases does NOT exist while calculating time complexity?
Ans: Null case (Average case, Best case, Worst case)

2.The recurrence equation T(n) = T(n/2) + 1 represents the time complexity of which algorithmic paradigm? 
a.Divide and Conquer (correct)
b.Greedy Algorithms 
c.Dynamic Programming 
d.More than one of the above
e.None of the above

**Divide and Conquer: This paradigm involves breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems of the same type. 
The solution to the original problem is then composed of the solutions to the sub-problems. 
The recurrence relation T(n) = T(n/2) + 1 is characteristic of Divide and Conquer algorithms, where a problem of size 'n' is divided into two sub-problems of size 'n/2', and the "+ 1" term represents the work done at each level or merging step.

**Greedy Algorithms: Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. 
They don't necessarily involve recurrence relations like the one mentioned; instead, they typically involve making the best decision at each step without considering the overall impact. 

**Dynamic Programming: Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm where a problem is broken down into smaller overlapping sub-problems, and the solutions to these sub-problems are memoized or stored to avoid redundant computations. 
The recurrence relation for dynamic programming often involves combining solutions to sub-problems, and it can be expressed in terms of the solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. 

**Brute Force: Brute Force algorithms exhaustively explore all possible solutions to a problem without using any clever optimization techniques. They do not typically involve recurrence relations in the same systematic way as Divide and Conquer or Dynamic Programming.
